## <a name="intro" id="intro"></a>Overview

This modern version of the "*Rastor's Item pack*" nerves some items with too much power and raises some others with not enough power.

&nbsp;

<details><summary>Original note from the author</summary>
<p>

###### For as long as I can remember, I have been seeing people complaining about the "*overpowered*" or "*underpowered*" items that are present in the official release of Baldur's Gate II. I decided to fix those complaints while teaching myself to modify items in the Infinity Engine at the same time. "*Rastor's Item Pack*" was the result of my playing around.

###### Over the years, the modding community has gone through a veritable revolution. During that time, IEEP (once the standard) was rendered obsolete, WeiDU went through a number of advances, and the standards expected from the modding community in general vastly improved. Unfortunately, this pack did not evolve with the community. It remained the old collection of a dozen items or so that I had whipped up on an early release of IEEP in 2001, until now.

###### The name of the mod has been changed to reflect the contributions of the modding community and players although the nostalgic core of the mod is still present. Enjoy!

## <a name="installation" id="installation"></a>Installation

#### Notes

*If you've previously installed the mod, remove it before extracting the new version. To do this, run **`setup-ritemppack.exe`**, un-install all previously installed components and delete the :file_folder: **ritempack** folder.*

*When installing or un-installing, **do not close the DOS window** by clicking on the **X** button! Instead, press the **Enter** key whenever instructed to do so.*

*__Disable any antivirus__ or other memory-resident software before installing this or any other mod. Some (particularly avast and Norton!) have a tendency to report false positives with mod activity, resulting in failed installs.*

## 

## 

#### Note for Complete Un-installation

In addition to the methods above for removing individual components, you can completely un-install the mod using **`setup-ritemppack --uninstall`** at the command line to remove all components without wading through prompts.</br>
